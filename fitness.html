      <h2>Improving the diary feature of the My Fitness Pal App.</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve used <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com" target="_blank" title="My Fitness Pal">My Fitness Pal</a> on and off for the past few years to log my food and exercise. The longest I’ve used it in one time span was only about 2 weeks. It always starts with ambitious intentions—to try to improve my habits and to start a healthier lifestyle. Yet, my motivation soon dies off because daily logging gets boring very quickly. My Fitness Pal is straight forward and simple, which makes it extremely easy to use. But, without much feedback and encouragement, it’s difficult to remember the value of a health diary after a while.

      <h2>Looking at what works and what can be improved.</h2>
      <p>
        I started by doing a quick critique of the current app, mainly the diary page because this was the feature I used most. This helped me identify areas of improvement for the re-design.

      <h2>Strategy for the re-design.</h2>
      <p>
        There were three areas I thought could be improved to help increase user engagement, which I framed in the view of the customer to keep the project goals user-aligned.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Give me useful insights at a glance.</strong><br>How can the stats be more actionable and easier to read?</li>
        <li><strong>Make me feel great about logging my day.</strong><br>How can gamification and words of encouragement be used to inspire users?</li>
        <li><strong>Help me achieve my health goals.</strong><br>How can more tips and suggestions be added to help users improve their habits?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Overview of Final Design</h2>
      <p>
        My redesign of the diary page increases user engagement through helpful feedback and suggestions, encouraging gamification, and a more visual dashboard. User engagement would be measured by how long and often people use the diary feature or “streaks”, as it’s called on the app. Success would be longer streaks, which would show that users are staying interested and are still seeing value in the app over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Success could also be measured by the amount of times users achieve the “Excellent” rating, an increase could mean that users are learning from the app and improving their choices. An increase in the usage of the suggested recipe feature would also show success, because it’s relatively hidden in the current app.

      <h2>Details: A More Visual Summary</h2>
      <p>Adding hierarchy and a progress bar in the summary helps users quickly understand how much they have left to make a decision for their next meal.</p>

      <h2>Details: Feedback and Gamification</h2>
      <p>I added ratings as feedback and gamification to acknowledge the users’ actions and to motivate them to keep logging. It rewards good behavior and serves as a benchmark and learning opportunity for meal choices that need improvement. I also added badges as reminders of an achievement when users reach mini-milestone, which is extra encouragement throughout the day.</p>

      <h2>Details: Helpful Suggestions</h2>
      <p>The existing app lacked features for helping users plan ahead, it was only great for analyzing what they had already done, which is only half the battle. Moving “Meal Ideas” into the diary could add value by inspiring users with solutions to reach their goals. It will also increase the visibility and usefulness for that feature by surfacing it in a more relevant context.</p>
