      <h2>Divvy Homes aims to make real estate investment more accessible by making group ownership easy.</h2>
      <p>
        This early stage start-up provides tools to help groups buy real estate together, complete legal paperwork, and manage the property fairly. Divvy needed to release an MVP of their Home Manager app as soon as possible because they already had customers in the funnel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app had been mapped out by the product manager and was starting to be developed. I was asked to improve the product the best I could in a few hours. I had to be creative in making efficient changes to maximize usability and enhance product strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I focused on making the financial information actionable and easy to understand, adding bits of education to help customers learn and build confidence. I also developed the visual elements to improve usability and legibility, rather than just designing for looks.

      <h2>Making property management less intimidating.</h2>
      <p>
        Most Divvy customers won’t be familiar with real estate management. They might be first time home buyers or casual investors looking to expand their portfolio. The Divvy Home Manager needed to make them feel confident about their investment.

      <h2>Establishing style guide and grid.</h2>
      <p>
        For the visual design, I started by creating a basic style guide and grid system. As I progressed with the project, I added more text styles and components as needed. Having a template upfront helped me maintain design consistency, which translated into a more cohesive experience. It also saved time (which I didn’t have a lot of) because I didn't need to reinvent the wheel for every element.

      <h2>Weaving in helpful hints.</h2>
      <p>
        The Divvy Home Manager is only useful if the customer understands how to utilize it. Explaining the significance of the numbers and educating the customer helps them feel secure in their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adding explanations and actionable tips to the financial graphs help customers learn how to read it. Highlighting notable data points also teaches them what to look for. The mini-lessons, given in context, slowly makes the financial data more comprehensible—which in turn, makes the customer more confident about their investment.

      <h2>Making the actions simple.</h2>
      <p>
        Since customers are looking to us to assist them in real estate management, we needed to find ways to lessen their workload. There will always be an endless list of tasks to be done—prioritizing it for the customer saves them time. I added notifications to help differentiate between urgent tasks and tasks that could be saved for later.
      </p>
      <p>
        I designed the actions to be simple, like an easy approve or deny, a short expense report form, or a quick pay option. As an assistant, we make it as easy as possible for customers to get things done and make decisions.

      <h2>Designing the tables for readability.</h2>
      <p>
        The expenses are tracked in spreadsheets that can be overwhelming—sometimes it can be difficult to tell which numbers are important. To help users parse information quickly, I used background color, font weight, and indentation, to create hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also reduced cognitive load by showing less information at once and introduced pagination to manage the timeline. Less text and alternating background colors helped make the spreadsheet even easier to read.

      <h2>Building off the first pass.</h2>
      <p>
        This was an interesting project because the product was unique and at such an early stage. We didn’t have any customers yet, so it was difficult to get accurate information about what was important for the app. The next steps would be to gather real feedback by interviewing and watching customers use the product.
      </p>

      <h2>Small details can affect the project in a big way.</h2>
      <p>
        This project proved that the details can make an impact on the overall product and should deserve more thought and strategy. Also, often times visual design is looked at as just the “prettifying” phase. This project shows how it can be used to improve usability and functionality instead.
