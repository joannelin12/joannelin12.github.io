    <!-- Overview -->
    <div class="section">
      <span class="section-tag">Overview</span>
      <h2>After the launch of our new NatureBox e-commerce website, our main focus was acquiring customers.</h2>
      <p>
        But as we grew our customer base, we noticed that only a small number were ordering a second and third time. We needed to shift the focus and improve our repeat-order rate in order for the business to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at the data, we saw that existing customers were clicking through emails, which showed their interest. But when they got to the website, they didn’t buy anything. We hypothesized that customers will purchase, if they can easily find the items and information they're looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
        I led the user experience and visual design execution in personalizing the member experience. Using customer insights and past order data, we redesigned the homepage layout to cater to returning customer behavior. The result increased repeat purchase by XX% and average order value by XX%.

    <!-- Problem -->
    <div class="section">
      <span class="section-tag">Problem</span>
      <h2>We were treating all customers the same.</h2>
      <p>
        Our current homepage was geared towards product discovery, a user goal for new customers. Session recordings and repeat-order data showed that the behavior of returning customers was very different. They already knew what they liked and were coming back for different reasons. We needed to change the homepage to show them what they wanted to see.

    <!-- Goals -->
    <div class="section">
      <span class="section-tag">Goals</span>
      <h2>Helping customers achieve their goals.</h2>
      <p>
        Using customer insight data from NPS surveys, we were able to pinpoint why people were coming back to the site. If returning customers could find relevant information and products quickly, they might be more likely to purchase.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>I want to order what I liked last time.</strong><br>How can we make it easy to re-order from past purchases?</li>
        <li><strong>I want to try something new.</strong><br>How can we help them discover new snacks more quickly?</li>
        <li><strong>I want to check on my account and order.</strong><br>How can we provide useful updates right on the homepage?</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Design -->
    <div class="section">
      <span class="section-tag">Design</span>
      <h2>Brainstorming and testing ideas.</h2>
      <p>
        The first step was brainstorming different ways to incorporate account and order information into the shopping experience and figuring out the best way to show relevant products. Then, I narrowed down the ideas through user testing.
      </p>

      <p>
        The testers were given tasks that mimicked the three main user goals. The most effective solution was the one that helped users achieve their goals the fastest. The winning layout was a condensed catalog with a mini dashboard.

      <p class="caption">People often shop with photos, so in this case, we tested with hi-fidelity mockups instead of wireframes to create a more realistic shopping experience.</p>

      <h2>Convenient updates.</h2>
      <p>
        A common reason to come back to the site was to check order status. Surfacing that information on the first page took away the need for customers to spend time finding it themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        A mini dashboard that shows the order status and tracking number allows customers achieve their goal right away. With that extra time and because they didn’t need to navigate away, they can scroll down to browse the catalog. The dashboard also reminds them about their store credit for extra shopping encouragement. 
      </p>

      <h2>Rethinking the catalog.</h2>
      <p>
        The catalog needed to let customers easily re-order products and also discover new products more quickly. Through testing, we found that the best layout was a condensed catalog with carousels. Showing smaller thumbnails allows customers to scan items more quickly, which increases their chances of finding something they want. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To prevent overwhelming customers with too many options, the new catalog had only 3 categories: New, Recent Purchases, and Recently Back in Stock. If they were interested in browsing more, they could easily shop by categories at the top or bottom of the catalog.

    <!-- Execution -->
    <div class="section">
      <span class="section-tag">Execution</span>
      <h2>Repeat-order was up by XX% and AOV by XX%.</h2>
      <p>
        The new layout was very different, so we wanted to A/B test into it carefully. That way, we could understand exactly what parts worked and what didn’t. The design was introduced section by section above the old layout, starting with the dashboard. When all the sections were up, we tested a version without the old layout below, which was the design that won.
      <p>
        By addressing the customers' goals, we were able to achieve our business one. This project is a great example of how user behavior can shape design.
