      <h2>Improving the check-in experience for Hotelzzz guests.</h2>
      <p>
        I chose this feature for the design exercise because of its relevance in my life right now.  I’m currently on a trip through Peru and Bolivia and have been checking into hotels every few days. Because I’ve stayed in about 8 different hotels so far, I’ve had a wide range of check-in experiences—some were swift while most were slow. When I didn’t have the booking information printed or when things got lost in translation, it dragged out the process even more. I’ve also had to ask for basic hotel information, like WiFi access or check-out time at most hotels, during check-in.
      </p>
      <p>
        I designed a feature for the Hotelzzz app that automatically checks the guest in, so they can access their room immediately after arriving to the hotel. This project also includes a feature to allow guests to easily extend their stay, from anywhere and at anytime. This streamlined process improves the customer experience because it allows guests to spend more time enjoying the destination.

      <h2>After a long day in transit, many guests just want to go straight to their room.</h2>
      <p>
        The typical hotel check-in process can be unnecessarily long. Before getting to your room, you have to go to the front desk (there might be a line!), show your booking info, and get assigned a room number to receive the keys. This can take anywhere from 5-15 minutes, with most of it just waiting around.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to extend your stay, you have to make another trip back to the front desk and wait for them to check for availability. Then, you might need to turn in your key card to be updated.

      <h2>Setting up the project goals</h2>
      <p>
        A faster experience would allow the user to achieve their goal as quickly as possible—getting to the room that they booked. Though speed is important, it isn’t the only goal. A process that is fast, but requires a lot of mental energy from the user isn’t ideal. Also, a process that is efficient but cold, doesn’t make for great hospitality. Keeping the Hotelzzz Mission in mind, I set up goals to keep the project focused:
      </p>
      <h3>Hotelzzz Mission:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Delight guests with a great experience.</li>
        <li>Emerge as a leader in the hospitality space.</li>
        <li>Utilize technology to bring the industry into the digital world.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>User Goals:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Don't waste my time.</strong><br>How can the process be quicker, so guests have more time to enjoy the destination?</li>
        <li><strong>Do the work for me.</strong><br>How can the process be as effortless as possible for the guest?</li>
        <li><strong>Keep it personal.</strong><br>How can an efficient process still retain good hospitality and customer service?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>Customer journey maps reveal opportunities.</h2>
      <p>
       My first step, when defining the problem, was to record the typical experience. Laying out the entire customer flow helped me see opportunities to improve, like detecting location or removing the need to go to the front desk. Recreating a new customer journey allowed me to focus on the big picture before getting into details of what the screen should look like.

      <h2>Sorting info and sketching out screens.</h2>
      <p>
        After making a new customer journey map, I started to group information and lay out the digital experience. Sketching on paper helps me quickly get ideas out, try different solutions, and combine them. At this point, I'll decide how many screens I might need and their general purpose, before I start wireframing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this phase, I also figured out where in the Hotelzzz app this feature might live. I think it's important to at least understand the context of a feature and how people might access it, in order to design it completely. After running through a couple ideas, I decided that the feature would be accessed from the home and bookings tab of this hypothetical app.
