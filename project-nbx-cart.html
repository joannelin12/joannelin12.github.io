      <h2>At NatureBox, we launched a new e-commerce website, leaving the subscription snack box behind.</h2>
      <p>
        Our MVP had a cart page as an intermediate step before checkout to give customers a chance to review their order. Post launch, we noticed low page views and a noticeable drop off there. This was an opportunity for us to increase conversion and improve the shopping experience for our customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I led the user experience and visual design execution on this project. We improved the add-to-cart experience using web analytics data and user tests to inform and validate design decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result increased conversion by 40% and average order value by 21%.

      <h2>Digging deeper to identify the issues.</h2>
      <p>
        Session recordings and web analytics data showed that our site wasn’t working hard to drive people to checkout. We also noticed that users were going back and forth from the catalog to the cart, losing their place in the process. The shopping experience was disjointed and lacked feedback after customers added an item.

    <!-- Goals -->
    <div class="section">
      <span class="section-tag">Goals</span>
      <h2>Setting user and business goals.</h2>
      <p>
        It’s easy to get lost in a project, so before starting the design process, I defined goals that would help with design decisions later.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Help me keep track of my cart while I shop. </strong><br>How can we give updates so they don’t have to constantly check the cart?</li>
        <li><strong>Make it easier for me to edit my items on the fly. </strong><br>How can we streamline the cart experience?</li>
        <li><strong>Make me feel great about the savings I’m getting. </strong><br>How can we positively reinforce their decision to shop at NatureBox?</li>
        <li><strong>Remind me to checkout, but don’t be pushy about it. </strong><br>How can we encourage customers to checkout without being annoying?</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Design -->

      <h2>Creating a more convenient cart.</h2>
      <p>
        In real life, a shopping cart stays by your side while you shop, allowing you to swap items and manage your budget as you go. I wanted to mimic that natural shopping experience as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        We added a “cart preview” that had some features of the cart, but was less disruptive than loading a whole new page. The shopping context is maintained, allowing customers to easily continue where they left off. Usability testing helped decide how much information to show, how to open it, and where to locate it.
      </p>

      <h2>Being helpful without being disruptive.</h2>
      <p>
        The existing experience had minimal add-to-cart feedback, only a simple text change in the CTA. We wanted show updates as the customer shopped, to help them keep track of their order and also as positive reinforcement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through testing, I narrowed the design down to a small 3 second notification that had an updated cart total and savings. It shows the optional information peripherally and doesn't interrupt the shopping experience, even on mobile.

    <!-- Execution -->
    <div class="section">
      <span class="section-tag">Execution</span>
      <h2>Conversion was up by 40% and AOV by 21%.</h2>
      <p>
        We ran a series of A/B tests to narrow down the details of each feature. In the end, a combination of the notification and cart preview shown above, won--the results reached statistical significance in a week.
      </p>

    <!-- Post-launch -->
    <div class="section">
      <span class="section-tag">Post-launch</span>
      <h2>More testing and continual improvements.</h2>
      <p>
        After launch, I continued to improve the features through additional user and A/B testing. It helped refine details like the how to hide/show the order summary and how to show the savings. We're constantly improving the shopping experience, as we learn more about our customers.
