      <h2>Dor is a foot traffic analytics solution that focuses on accuracy, affordability, and self-installation.</h2>
      <p>
        For the alpha launch, we included a paper installation guide along with the hardware that was sent out to the customer. Post-launch, the team received an overwhelming amount of troubleshooting calls. We realized that the installation process was more complex than a set of paper instructions could efficiently explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dor wanted to ship a new installation process as soon as possible. I was hired to brainstorm a solution and design the user experience. Using customer feedback and in-field learnings from the alpha launch, we created a new personalized web on-boarding experience to replace the paper instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result was a flexible design system that allowed ongoing improvements and most importantly, significantly less troubleshooting tickets.

      <span class="section-tag">Problem</span>
      <h2>The paper instructions much took up too technical support time.</h2>
      <p>
        The Dor hardware system required a specific installation sequence, hardware orientation and location to correctly gather foot traffic data. Customers were skipping steps, installing parts in the wrong order, and were unaware that it was setup incorrectly.

      <span class="section-tag">Goals</span>
      <h2>Turning the issues into actionable goals.</h2>
      <p>
        We had a mountain of feedback, which I developed into user goals to guide the new design.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Make it customized to my business and store.</strong><br>How can we personalize the experience to show only relevant information?</li>
        <li><strong>Guide me through, but keep me focused.</strong><br>How can we show just the right amount of information?</li>
        <li><strong>Make me feel confident that I’ve installed it correctly.</strong><br>How can we provide feedback and checkpoints along the way?</li>
        <li><strong>Let me delegate it to my staff.</strong><br>How can we make it so that anyone could install the system?</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Design -->
    <div class="section">
      <span class="section-tag">Design</span>
      <h2>Understanding the process to improve it.</h2>
      <p>
        First, I had to get familiar with the details of the installation process. Organizing the information into groups and subgroups helped me understand the process as a whole and eventually helped me break it down into simpler steps for the customer.
      </p>

      <p class="caption">Notes I took to get my head around the customer and installation experience.</p>
      <p>
        Then, working with the engineering team, I mapped out a basic flow, which helped us see the entire of tree of decisions/steps. With that, I decided how the process could be customized, where feedback made sense, and how much information to show in each step.

      <h2>Designing a flexible template.</h2>
      <p>
        With the basic steps outlined, I created a template that could be reused for each step. The design needed to accommodate steps that were very different—from mounting a bracket to checking a connection. But the information had to be presented in a similar way every time, to reduce cognitive load through consistency.

      <h2>Guiding the installation using friction and feedback.</h2>
      <p>
        Usually adding friction is bad UX, but in this case, I added friction to improve the installation experience. One issue from the alpha launch was customers installing things out of order. This was because the paper instructions presented all the information at once, which incited the temptation to multi-task.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the new experience, each step has one clear goal that must be completed before moving on. Though the process is longer, showing less information keeps the user focused and reduces mistakes. It also promotes a sense of safety and trust, by taking the responsibility off the user to get it installed correctly.

      <p>
        To balance the friction, I added more feedback—showing progress as steps get completed and providing checkpoints to help installers know if they've installed it correctly so far.

      <h2>Customizing to simplify the installation.</h2>
      <p>
        Every customer situation is different: some need more sensors, others have several store locations, and everyone has different types of doors. But, for the alpha launch, everyone received the same instructions.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/dor/chart.jpg">
      <p class="caption">The original paper instructions included this chart to decide mounting location.</p>

      <p>
        I created a quiz to help customers determine the how their hardware should be installed. After answering a few questions about the type and size of their door, they are given installation instructions specific to their situation. This reduces mistakes because the installers don’t have to figure it out on their own.
      </p>

      <p class="caption">Answer a few easy questions and we'll tell you where to install it.</p>

      <p>
        Another way we customized the process was utilizing the unique serial numbers on the hardware. We could tell which customer it was by just a serial number. This allows anyone to install it, without signing in. Once we know who the customer is, we can show only the information that's relevant to them.

      <h2>A feedback loop.</h2>
      <p>
        The Dor team adds steps and modifies the installation process as they learn of new issues. Though I'm no longer actively working on it, the design system I created allows enough flexibility for ongoing improvements, while still keeping the experience cohesive.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project confirmed the importance of testing in field. It's impossible to account for all use cases with just research and surveys. Most problems don't come up when asked, but when the product or process is actually being used. Feedback from the both releases revealed nuances about the customer and industry, I never would have guessed on my own.
