<div class="about">
  <p>
    Iâ€™m a strategic designer who believes that every design decision should be deliberate. I solve problems creatively using data, customer feedback, unrestrained ideation, and continual iteration.

    With an architecture background, I am adept at designing within systems and at vastly different scales, executing bigger picture concepts as well as creating the fine details.
